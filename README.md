##Summary
Started off in the course with learning about functions and stuff(check ```func.dart```). Then moved on to classes and variables(just some basics, check ```classesnvars.dart```). Learnt some flutter(not much though, check ```scratch```) and then learnt about constructors(check ```constructors.dart```)

**Thanks for reading, Day 1 ends here.**
