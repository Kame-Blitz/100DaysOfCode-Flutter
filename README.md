* Dart
    * Private Properties.(```pad1/main.dart```)
    * Creating Multiple Contructors.(```pad3/pad3.dart```)
    * Maps.(```pad5/main.dart``)
    * Final v/s Constant
* Flutter
    * Creating a custom widget.(```pad1/qs.dart```)
    * Centering the ```Text()``` Widget.(```pad2/qs.dart```)
    * To run ```pad4/main.dart```, you will also need ```pad3/qs.dart```.
    * Mapping Lists to Widgets.
    
 ## Summary
 Things seemed to be quite confusing today especially mapping lists to widget and how a final is different from a constant, though I was able to pull it off. I liked seeing the app come in action(well, almost). I will complete this app by tomorrow(hopefully).
